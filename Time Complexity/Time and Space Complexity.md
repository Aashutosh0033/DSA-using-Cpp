# Time Complexity

Time Complexity is time taken by an Alogorithm as a function of length of input. Time Complexity is most commonly expressed using Big O notation. It is a type of Asymptotic Notation used to describe the worst time complexity of a given algorithm. In coding problems we usually find the worst time complexity to execute the code. 
<br>
<br>
Time Complexity is most commonly estimated by counting the elementary steps performed by any algorithm to complete the execution.<br>
<br>
For Ex.<br>
Observe the code below<br>
```C++
for(int i=0, i<n,i++){
    //code
}
```

The above code has n number of steps in it to complete the execution of the code. So its time complexity will directly be proportional to n.<br>

**Big O Notation** : This is an asymptotic notation used to measure the worst case time complexity of a given algorithm. <br>
<br>
Note : Big O noatation considers only the upper bound of the equation and it ignores the lower bounds and constants of the equation.<br>

**Order of Growth** : constant < loglog(n) < log(n) < n^1/3 < n^1/2 < n < n^2 < n^3 < 2^n < n! < n^n <br>

# Space Complexity

Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm (including the input values to the algorithm) to execute and produce the result.<br>
Sometime Auxiliary Space is confused with Space Complexity. But Auxiliary Space is the extra space or the temporary space used by the algorithm during it's execution.
Space Complexity = Auxiliary Space + Input space <br> 
<br> 
Most primitive (Booleans & Numbers) take up O(1) / Constant space <br> 
Strings, Arrays & Objects take up O(n) / Linear space <br>
