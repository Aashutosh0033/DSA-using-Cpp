## Searching Algorithms
<br> 

Searching algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these operations are generally classified into two categories : <br>


**->Sequential Search**<br>
**->Interval Search** 

*Sequential Search* : In this , the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example Linear Search. <br>

*Interval Search* : These algorithms are specificaly designed for searching in the sorted data-structures. These types of searching algorithmns are much more efficient than linear searches, they repeatedly target the center of the search. For example : Binary Search.
