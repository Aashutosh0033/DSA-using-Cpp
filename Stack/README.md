### Stack 

Stack is a linear Data Structure which operates on LIFO (Last in First Out) or FILO (First in Last Out) pattern.
It is an ADT (Abstact Data Type).
Real life example of stack is books kept on one another.<br/><br/>

**Applications of Stack :**<br/>
-> Stacks can be used for expression evaluation.<br/>
-> Stacks can be used to check parenthesis matching in an expression.<br/>
-> Stacks can be used for Memory Management.<br/>
-> Stacks can be used to manage Function Calls.<br/>
-> Stacks are used in Redo-Undo features in editors.<br/>
-> Stacks are used in cache memory.<br/><br/>


**Standard Stack Functions**<br/>
*push()* - takes an element and pushes it on top of the stack. (If stack is full and push is called, it is known as Overflow state)<br/>
*pop()* - removes an element from the top and returns it. (If the stack is empty and pop is called it is known as *Underflow state)<br/>
*isEmpty()* - checks if the stack is empty or not.<br/>
*isFull()* - checks if the stack is full or not.<br/>
*peek()* - access the element at i th position.<br/>
*count()* - gets the number of items in the stack.<br/>
*change()* - updates an element at the i th position.<br/>
*display()* - displays all elements in the stack.<br/>
