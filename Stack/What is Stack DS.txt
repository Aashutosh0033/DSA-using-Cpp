** Standard Stack Functions **

push() - takes an element and pushes it on top of the stack. (If stack is full and push is called, it is known as Overflow state)
pop() - removes an element from the top and returns it. (If the stack is empty and pop is called it is known as Underflow state)
isEmpty() - checks if the stack is empty or not.
isFull() - checks if the stack is full or not.
peek() - access the element at i th position.
count() - gets the number of items in the stack.
change() - updates an element at the i th position.
display() - displays all elements in the stack.
