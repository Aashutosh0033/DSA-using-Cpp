### Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. Here, each node contains data and address of the next node.<br>
In linked list data is not stored in contiguos memory locations.<br><br>

**Applicaitons :**<br>
->Linked List can be used to implement Stack, Queue, Graph, Hash Tables, etc.<br>
->Undo functionality of Softwares.<br>
->Accessing previous or next pages on a website.<br><br>

**Standard Linked List functions**<br>
*append()* - Appends a new node (to the end of) list.<br>
*prepend()* - Prepends a new node (to start of) list.<br>
*insert()* - Inserts a new node (at a specific position) in the list.<br>
*delete()* - Deletes a specific node from the list.<br>
*update()* - Updates a specific node in the list.<br><br>

**Types of Linked List**<br>
->Singly Linked List<br>
->Doubly Linked List<br>
->Circular Linked List<br><br>

*Singly Linked List :* A singly linked list is a type of list in which each node consists of two components (a)Data (b)Next Node Address<br>

*Doubly Linked List :* A doubly linked list a type of list in which each node consists of three components (a)Previous Node Address (b)Data (c)Next Node Address<br>

*Circular Linked List :* A circular linked list is similar to the singly linked list but the difference is, in circular linked list the last node is connected to the first node.
