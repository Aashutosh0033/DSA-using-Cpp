### This repo contains all the important Data Structures and Algorithms and their implementations.<br>
<br>

*Data structures serve as the basis for abstract data types (ADT). The ADT defines the logical form of the data type. The data structure implements the physical form of the data type.<br>
Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks.<br>
Data structures provide a means to manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses such as large databases and internet indexing services. Usually, efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms.<br>
Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as the key organizing factor in software design. Data structures can be used to organize the storage and retrieval of information stored in both main memory and secondary memory.*<br>
